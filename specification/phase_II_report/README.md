Phase II: Design Report

This report is meant to provide the data structure and logic to
carry out the functionalities dictated by the specification. Keep
in mind the implementation will be entirely based on this document,
adequate details should thus be given at length.

1. Introduction
an overall picture of the system using collaboration class diagram

2. All use cases

o Collaboration or sequence class diagram for each use case
o State diagram or Petri-net for each case

3. E-R diagrams for the entire system
attributes and key for each class should be provided

4. Detailed design:
for EVERY method use pseudo-code to delineate the input/output and
main functionalities

5. System screens:
